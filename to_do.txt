Questions:
Answer: Probably fine. older versions probably bad.
    Proper linux version
        kernel listed on variscite VAR-SOM-MX6 product page: https://www.variscite.com/products/system-on-module-som/cortex-a9/var-som-mx6-cpu-freescale-imx6/
        latest release of Linux kernel is 4.15: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/BionicBeaver/ReleaseNotes#Linux_kernel_4.15
        latest documented supported ubuntu release is 17.04: https://www.yoctoproject.org/docs/latest/ref-manual/ref-manual.html#detailed-supported-distros
        current linux version is 18.04.1
        kernel readout from uname -r: 4.15.0-42-generic

Answer: This is basically part of the challenge, and the reason for documentation.
    Recommended initial reading of "quick start guide" seemingly not available for VAR-SOM-MX6 Yocto. Seemingly available for e.g. android, as well as other
    VAR-SOM versions. Are these applicable?
